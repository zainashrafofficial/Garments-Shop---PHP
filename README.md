# Garments Shop - E-commerce Project

Welcome to the **Garments Shop** E-commerce project repository! This project was developed during my university semester coursework, showcasing a fully functional e-commerce system with core features implemented using various web technologies.

This e-commerce platform is designed to provide a complete shopping experience with functionalities such as product browsing, user authentication, cart management, and administrative control. Although the user interface is not highly modernized due to time constraints, the project emphasizes robust backend functionality and database integration.

### Why This Project?

I developed this project under tight deadlines while managing multiple responsibilities, including university exams and professional commitments as a Software Engineer at **Hywiz Technologies**, a Software Development & Digital Marketing Company. As a result, while the UI design is basic, the core functionality is fully implemented and demonstrates my ability to deliver functional software solutions within constraints.
